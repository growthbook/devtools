# Visual Editor

To run the Visual Editor locally and to be able to develop it:

1. Follow steps 1 - 3 in the above 'Build and Release' section to get Chrome Extension loaded locally in your browser.
2. Log into the GrowthBook web app.
3. Create or navigate to an Experiment.
4. Once created, click the CTA for 'Open Visual Editor'.
    1. If the experiment is new, it will ask you for a URL. Enter the URL of the site you wish to edit.
5. When running a dev version of the Chrome Extension, the GB app will give you a warning that it does not detect the editor. This is okay - Click 'Proceed anyway' to move further.
6. Viola! You should see the Visual Editor load.
    1. In the case that you don't, you'll probably see an error message regarding the CSP of the website you're trying to hit. This will require some configuration on the website's side to loosen restrictions - read our docs to [see what is required](https://docs.growthbook.io/app/visual#security-requirements).
